                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p id="p10">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from 
                professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
                student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
                did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team 
                project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent 
                experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers.
